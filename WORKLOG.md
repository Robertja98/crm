# WORKLOG

Purpose: rolling implementation record for this project.
Update method: append newest entry at the top with date, scope, key changes, file touchpoints, and validation notes.

## 2026-04-24 - Ledger Parity Monitoring Page

### Scope (Ledger Parity Monitoring Page)

- Add a parity-check report to compare legacy and canonical ledgers during migration.

### Key Changes (Ledger Parity Monitoring Page)

- Added a dedicated page: `inventory_ledger_parity.php`.
- Added summary counters for legacy/canonical totals and linked canonical source_ref rows.
- Added three parity sections:
  - legacy rows missing canonical records
  - quantity mismatches between legacy and canonical rows
  - canonical orphan rows with `source_ref` not found in legacy table
- Added a `Ledger Parity` navigation button from movement history.

### Important Files (Ledger Parity Monitoring Page)

- CRM/inventory_ledger_parity.php
- inventory_ledger_parity.php
- CRM/inventory_movement_history.php
- inventory_movement_history.php

### Validation (Ledger Parity Monitoring Page)

- Diagnostics check: no errors in CRM and root parity/history/export files.

### Notes (Ledger Parity Monitoring Page)

- This page supports fallback deprecation decisions with objective parity evidence.

## 2026-04-24 - Transaction Ledger Phase 2 Read Cutover (Fallback-Safe)

### Scope (Transaction Ledger Phase 2 Read Cutover)

- Switch movement history and export reads to canonical transactions where available.
- Preserve backward compatibility with legacy movement table during transition.

### Key Changes (Transaction Ledger Phase 2 Read Cutover)

- Added canonical-first read logic in history and export endpoints.
- Added automatic fallback to `inventory_movements` when canonical table is missing or empty.
- Normalized canonical fields to current UI/export schema so pages remain unchanged.
- Preserved sorting and date/item filters across both sources.

### Important Files (Transaction Ledger Phase 2 Read Cutover)

- CRM/inventory_movement_history.php
- CRM/inventory_movement_export.php
- inventory_movement_history.php
- inventory_movement_export.php

### Validation (Transaction Ledger Phase 2 Read Cutover)

- Diagnostics check: no errors in CRM and root movement history/export files.

### Notes (Transaction Ledger Phase 2 Read Cutover)

- This allows incremental migration and parity checks before full legacy deprecation.

## 2026-04-24 - Transaction Ledger Phase 1 Dual-Write

### Scope (Transaction Ledger Phase 1 Dual-Write)

- Implement canonical transaction table and dual-write in quick inventory updates.
- Preserve existing movement logging and UI behavior.

### Key Changes (Transaction Ledger Phase 1 Dual-Write)

- Added `inventory_transactions` table bootstrap in quick update path.
- Added canonical transaction insert on normal adjustments (`inc`, `dec`, `set`).
- Added canonical reversal insert on undo with parent transaction lookup by source reference.
- Captured actor/session/network context hashes for future monitoring and AI scoring.
- Kept existing `inventory_movements` writes and notices unchanged for compatibility.

### Important Files (Transaction Ledger Phase 1 Dual-Write)

- CRM/inventory_quick_update.php
- inventory_quick_update.php

### Validation (Transaction Ledger Phase 1 Dual-Write)

- Diagnostics check: no errors in both CRM and root quick update files.

### Notes (Transaction Ledger Phase 1 Dual-Write)

- This is Phase 1 foundation; read paths still use `inventory_movements` until cutover.

## 2026-04-24 - Transaction Ledger V2 Design Record

### Scope (Transaction Ledger V2 Design Record)

- Define canonical transactional ledger model and long-horizon collection, storage, monitoring, and AI strategy.
- Define a canonical transactional ledger model for inventory adjustments and reversals.
- Document collection, archive, monitoring, learning, and AI enhancement strategy.

### Key Changes (Transaction Ledger V2 Design Record)

- Added deep-dive architecture document covering:
  - what to collect (transaction facts, context, actor/session, integrity, AI feedback)
  - how to store (append-only ledger, read models, archive)
  - what it means over 3/6/12 month horizons
  - AI staged rollout and governance
- Added a dedicated design document with:
  - Proposed inventory_transactions schema.
  - Reason code taxonomy and data capture standards.
  - Archive/retention approach.
  - Monitoring and KPI recommendations.
  - AI-assisted anomaly and recommendation strategy.
  - Phased implementation and starter SQL.

### Important Files (Transaction Ledger V2 Design Record)

- TRANSACTION_LEDGER_DEEP_DIVE.md
- CRM/TRANSACTION_LEDGER_DEEP_DIVE.md
- TRANSACTION_LEDGER_V2_PLAN.md
- CRM/TRANSACTION_LEDGER_V2_PLAN.md

### Validation (Transaction Ledger V2 Design Record)

- Confirmed deep-dive and design documents exist in root and CRM trees.

### Notes (Transaction Ledger V2 Design Record)

-- This entry is architectural guidance and design blueprint; does not alter runtime behavior yet.

## 2026-04-24 - Auth, Supplier Master, Inventory UX, Audit Trail

### Scope (Auth, Supplier Master, Inventory UX, Audit Trail)

- Authentication/session reliability improvements and routing cleanup.
- Supplier master data flow (source-of-truth supplier directory and cross-page integration).
- Inventory list UX modernization and operational safety enhancements.
- Quantity movement auditing, undo, history, export, filtering, and sorting.

### Key Changes (Auth, Supplier Master, Inventory UX, Audit Trail)

- Improved auth behavior to reduce unexpected sign-outs and reauth friction.
- Fixed path/routing issues in duplicated root/CRM structure.
- Established supplier master workflow with unique alphanumeric supplier IDs.
- Reworked inventory list to compact table UX with search/filter/sort/pagination.
- Added quick quantity actions (+/-/Set) with safety controls:
  - Large-jump confirmation.
  - Required reason for large Set changes.
  - One-click undo after update.
- Added inventory movement logging with metadata (old/new/delta/mode/reason/user/time).
- Added movement history page and CSV export.
- Added movement history date-range filters and all-column sorting.
- Added broader inventory-list sorting including supplier and operational headers.
- Resolved collation mismatch in movement join queries.

### Important Files (Auth, Supplier Master, Inventory UX, Audit Trail)

- Supplier: `supplier_directory.php`, `inventory_add.php`, `inventory_edit.php`, `purchase_order_add.php`
- Inventory list/updates: `inventory_list.php`, `inventory_quick_update.php`, `inventory_export.php`
- Movement history/export: `inventory_movement_history.php`, `inventory_movement_export.php`
- Navigation: `navbar-sidebar.php`
- Auth stack touchpoints: middleware/login/session flow files under `simple_auth/`

### Validation (Auth, Supplier Master, Inventory UX, Audit Trail)

- Repeated diagnostics checks reported no errors after patch batches.
- Sorting/filter/export consistency aligned across list/history/export endpoints.
- Undo + reason-required behavior verified through implemented flow and notices.

### Notes (Auth, Supplier Master, Inventory UX, Audit Trail)

- This repository contains mirrored files in root and `CRM/`; changes should continue to be applied/synced in both trees.
